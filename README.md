# Personal Portfiolio in Nuxt
Personal portfolio using Vue, Nuxt and Nuxt Content as CMS. Injects .md files as HTML in a vue components.

I already had a [personal portfolio in Vue](https://github.com/Tepexic/tepexic), but I only had static hosting, so sharing a blogpost or a link to any project was not possible. This is the Nuxt version of  it.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production
$ npm run build

# generate static project
$ npm run export

# Run local server to test built project
$ npm run serve
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
