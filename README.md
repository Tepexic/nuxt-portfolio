Personal portfolio using Vue, Nuxt and Nuxt Content as CMS. Injects .md files as HTML in a vue components. Includes "blog" and "projects" sections. Light/Dark mode theming included.

I already had a [personal portfolio in Vue](https://github.com/Tepexic/tepexic), but I only had static hosting, so sharing a blogpost or a link to any project was not possible. This is the Nuxt version of  it.
